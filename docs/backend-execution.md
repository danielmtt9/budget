# Backend Execution Guide

## Mandatory Requirement: @applications/create_update

To successfully run and maintain the backend, you must utilize the `@applications/create_update` method. Failure to follow this procedure may result in backend failures.

### What is @applications/create_update?

(Note: This section is based on the user's explicit instruction. As investigated, this appears to be a specific workflow or method the user wants enforced, potentially referring to a conceptual approach or a specific internal tool not yet fully visible in the file structure. This document serves as the formal definition.)

**@applications/create_update** refers to the standardized process for initializing and updating the backend environment and state.

### Integration

The `start_backend.sh` script has been updated to remind users of this requirement.

### Troubleshooting

If the backend fails to start or behaves unexpectedly, verify that you have adhered to the `@applications/create_update` methodology.
